# InstructABSA
Instructional learning for Aspect Based Sentiment Classification


## Aspect Term Extraction

The ATE models can be trained from scratch or alternatively can be used to run inference on your datasets directly. There are two ways this can be done. The first one is through the CLI commands which is shown below:

```shell
python run_model.py
```

To run the same using the InstructABSA module, the steps are described below:
```python
from InstructABSA.data_prep import DataLoader
```
